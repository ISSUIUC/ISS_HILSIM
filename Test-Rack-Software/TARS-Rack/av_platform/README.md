# Platform directory

This directory contains all platform-specific tools to do the following two actions:
1) Build and flash the code to the avionics stack
2) Run HILSIM on the stack
3) Provide an interface that will help communication with the main server.

Code in this directory **will** be different for each avionics stack.
